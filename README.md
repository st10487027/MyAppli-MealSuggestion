# Meal Suggestion App

This is a small Android APP I made for my school project.

The app helps you choose what meal to eat.

You type the tijme of dat, adn it shows you a mea suggestion.

For example:
  If you type in "Morning" it shows **BREAKFAST**
  If you type in " mid-morning" it shows **Brunch snacks**
  if you type in "afternoon" it shows **Lunch meal**
  if you type in "mid-afternoon" it shows **afternoon snacks**
  if you type in "Dinner" it shows **Dinner main meal**
  if you type in "after dinner" it shows **Dessert**

## How the App works
  - you type in time of day e.g "Morning" in the text box.
  - the app checks your answer
  - it suggests a meal based on what you typed in.
